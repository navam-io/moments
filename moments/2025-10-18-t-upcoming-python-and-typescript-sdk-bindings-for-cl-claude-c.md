  reasoning: >-
    Medium-high impact because: (1) dramatically lowers barrier to entry for
    Python and TypeScript developers, (2) enables integration into existing
    application codebases, (3) Python is dominant in AI/ML ecosystem, (4)
    TypeScript dominates web/Node.js development, (5) language bindings
    typically drive 3-5x adoption increases.
