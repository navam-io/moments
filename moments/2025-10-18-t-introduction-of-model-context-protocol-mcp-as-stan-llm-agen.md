    MCP represents a potential standardization moment for agent-tool
    integration. If adopted widely, it could become the de facto standard for
    how agents interact with external systems, similar to how REST APIs became
    standard for web services. This could reshape the tool integration ecosystem
    and impact companies building agent frameworks.

    Significant because: (1) Provides standardized integration pattern that
    could become industry standard; (2) Reduces lock-in to specific frameworks;
    (3) Enables ecosystem growth around MCP; (4) Could accelerate agent adoption
    by reducing integration complexity; (5) May influence how other AI providers
    design their agent systems.
