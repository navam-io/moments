    This is pivotal because structured output and session management are
    foundational capabilities for enterprise AI automation. These features
    enable reliable integration into production systems where deterministic,
    parseable responses are critical. Session state management enables complex
    multi-turn workflows previously impossible with stateless APIs.

  reasoning: >-
    High impact for enterprise adoption because: (1) structured output enables
    reliable automation without fragile text parsing, (2) session state enables
    complex workflows and user interactions, (3) these are table-stakes features
    for production AI systems, (4) reduces hallucination risks through
    deterministic output formats, (5) enables building stateful AI applications.

## Original Content

```
If you do d-output format JSON, uh, cloud code will actually output things or its response in JSON as opposed to plain text. And, uh, you can parse this JSON and build on top of it... when you call cloud-p in in structured output or JSON mode, it's going to return a session ID. Uh and this session ID is useful because you can then reference the session ID to go back to the same context state
