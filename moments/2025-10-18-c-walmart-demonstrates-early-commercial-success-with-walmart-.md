    Demonstrated ROI from agentic AI systems will accelerate enterprise
    adoption. The 18-week timeline reduction in fashion production is a
    significant competitive advantage that will likely prompt competitors to
    accelerate their own agentic AI initiatives. This validates the business
    case for autonomous systems beyond cost reduction.

## Original Content

```
From merchant tools that automate a range of time-intensive tasks, particularly entry and analysis, to Trend-to-Product, which shortens the traditional production timeline for Walmart fashion by as much as 18 weeks, we are exploring agentic systems to further optimize activities across our ecosystem such as associate tasks in our stores, customer shopping journeys online and merchandize planning in our home office. In our Customer Support Assistant, agents are already routing, resolving and, increasingly, acting autonomously to automate the mundane and free associates to focus on more complex tasks.
