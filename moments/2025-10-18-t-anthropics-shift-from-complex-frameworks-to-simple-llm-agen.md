    This is a pivotal moment because Anthropic is publicly establishing a new
    industry best practice that directly contradicts the current market trend of
    framework adoption (LangGraph, Bedrock AI Agent, Rivet, Vellum). This
    guidance from a major AI provider will influence architectural decisions
    across the industry and could impact the competitive positioning of
    framework-based companies.

    High impact because: (1) Comes from Anthropic, a tier-1 AI provider with
    significant customer influence; (2) Directly challenges existing framework
    market leaders; (3) Provides concrete architectural guidance that
    enterprises will adopt; (4) Could reduce demand for complex agent
    frameworks; (5) Establishes new evaluation criteria for agent development
    tools.

## Original Content

```
Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns... We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code.
