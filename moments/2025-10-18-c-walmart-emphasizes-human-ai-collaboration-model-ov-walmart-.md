## Original Content

```
Often, a co-pilot model, with humans and AI working as a team, is the most effective approach. Another key consideration is the human threshold for automation. We're carefully evaluating which actions are best suited for autonomous agent execution and where human oversight and approval remain essential. This highly intentional approach ensures we're building systems that are not only operationally efficient and trustworthy but keep human experience at the center.
