    This represents a methodological shift in how agents should be designed and
    evaluated. By formalizing ACI as a discipline, Anthropic is establishing new
    best practices that could influence how enterprises and startups approach
    agent development, potentially creating new categories of specialized tools
    and services.

    Moderate impact because: (1) Establishes new design discipline for agents;
    (2) Could influence how tools and frameworks are evaluated; (3) May create
    demand for ACI design expertise; (4) Provides framework for improving agent
    reliability; (5) However, primarily affects development methodology rather
    than market structure.
