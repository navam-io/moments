## Original Content

```
The way an agent shops is fundamentally different from the way a human shops. For example, agents may be less likely to be attracted to images or visuals designed to elicit an emotional response. So, while Walmart's core value proposition – Every Day Low Prices – and the spirit in which we market to customers won't change, we need to develop new pathways for agent discovery. These new pathways include things like advertising strategies tailored for agents and the development of agent-specific SEO.
