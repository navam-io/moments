    Walmart's articulation of infrastructure requirements for personal shopping
    agents suggests the need for new standards, APIs, and integration
    frameworks. This creates opportunities for middleware and integration
    platform vendors, but also indicates that Walmart will need to collaborate
    with external agent providers and potentially establish new partnership
    models.

    This is a forward-looking statement about future infrastructure needs rather
    than current capability. However, it signals that Walmart is thinking about
    interoperability and ecosystem standards, which could influence how the
    broader agent ecosystem develops. This may drive demand for integration
    platforms and agent orchestration tools.
