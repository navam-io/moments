    This represents a significant product expansion that democratizes AI-powered
    code automation. The SDK's headless nature enables integration into CI/CD
    pipelines, Unix tools, and custom applications - creating new categories of
    AI-native developer tools. This is a pivotal moment because it shifts Claude
    from a conversational interface to an infrastructure primitive.

## Original Content

```
What is the cloud code SDK? It is a way to programmatically access the power of the cloud code agent in headless mode. Uh this is powerful because uh it's a new kind of primitive and a new kind of building block that allows you to build applications that just weren't possible before.
