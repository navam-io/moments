    This represents validation of a specific high-value use case for agents. The
    adoption of usage-based pricing (charging only for successful resolutions)
    indicates sufficient agent reliability for production deployment. This could
    accelerate enterprise adoption of agents in customer support and establish a
    template for other industries.

    could become standard for agent services; (3) Validates ROI for enterprises
    considering agent deployment; (4) Could accelerate adoption across customer
    support industry; (5) However, limited to one specific use case.
